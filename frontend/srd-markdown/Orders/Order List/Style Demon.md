You zip across the battlefield, performing feats of great agility and assaulting enemies with a flurry of attacks. 
## Level 4
### [Expert Attacks]
You increase your proficiency with two chosen medium weapon types to expert. One of these must be melee, and the other must be ranged.
### Style
Whenever you successfully land an attack, succeed on a saving throw, or succeed on a skill check against an enemy, you gain 1 **Style**. Being hit by attacks, or failing on saving throws reduces your style by 1. Your style has a limit of 7, but is reduced to 5 at the end of your turn. 

You gain certain benefits when your style reaches certain stages, as follows:
* **1 Style**: You gain a +1 meter bonus to movement per Style.
* **3 Style**: When using **Focus**, you can choose to gain a +2 attack bonus and +2 AC bonus rather than a +5 attack bonus.
* **5 Style**: You can reload your ranged weapon as a free action after succeeding on a melee attack. This can be activated off of a melee attack that takes you to 5 style.
* **7 Style**: On all d20s, you roll twice and take the better result.
