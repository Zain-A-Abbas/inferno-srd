Your unstable spirit and earthly desire drive you to perform feats of great physical prowess.
## Level 4
### [Expert Attacks]
You increase your proficiency with a chosen heavy weapon type to expert. If your chosen sin is **Silent Fury**, then you may choose this for a medium weapon instead.
### Sin
Your sin is your expression of emotion, and grants you a unique benefit. You choose one, and this choice cannot be changed later.
* **Silent Fury (Wrath)**: Your demeanor and appearance betray your inner turmoil; someone, or something is the target of your rage. When wielding one medium weapon, you treat the damage potency as if using a heavy weapon.
* **Battle Thirst (Lust)**: You are addicted to being an instrument of destruction, and find enjoyment in bearing just as much pain. If you take damage from a critical attack or from critically failing a saving throw, you halve your multiple attack penalty until you land an attack with multiple attack penalty.
* **Explosive Furor (Pride)**: You are a gladiator; a warrior of your name or a cause you serve. 
### Rage
Upon being hit by an attack or failing a saving throw, you gain 1 **Rage**. If the attack is a critical hit or if you critically failed on the saving throw, you gain 2 Rage instead. You can expend Rage to perform special attacks. The following are the two default rage attacks:
* **(5 Rage) Power Attack (1-action)**: Make a melee attack, dealing maximum damage on all dice rolls. This attack is **Unbreakable**.
* **(5 Rage) Will-Obeying Blood (1-action)**: Gain temporary HP equal to twice your level.
