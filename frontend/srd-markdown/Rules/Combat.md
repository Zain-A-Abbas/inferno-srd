## Initiative
At the start of combat, the GM declares everyone to "roll initiative". Once initiative is rolled, the GM lists out the initiative of every character participating in the combat. Some enemies, usually bosses, will have multiple spots in the initiative. This enables them to act multiple times. If the player characters are vastly outnumbered, the GM may grant them extra actions as well.

## Actions
When a character's turn comes up, they have one tactical action and two standard actions. Characters also have free actions, which can be used an infinite number of times, and reactions, which are actions that can be used outside of their turn but only on the specified trigger. By default, characters only have one reaction that restores when their turn comes up in initiative, but some abilities can grant them extra reactions.

## Weapon Types
All weapons in the game are categorized as light, medium, or heavy. Light weapons are faster and more accurate than medium weapons, while heavy weapons do much more damage at the cost of reduced accuracy.

## Universal Abilities
### Attack (1-action)
Make an attack with a melee or ranged weapon. The character's attack roll is determined as follows:

**Level + proficiency in the weapon + STR or DEX + Weight Modifier**

Medium and heavy melee attacks use STR, while light melee attacks and all ranged attacks use DEX. The weight modifier is +2 for medium weapons, and +4 for light weapons.

If an attack succeeds, the attacker deals the following damage:

**Weapon dice + Damage Potency**

The Damage Potency for medium and heavy weapons is STR + level. For light weapons, it is (DEX + level) / 2. Medium and heavy ranged attacks don't halve their damage potency, but still use DEX.

After making an attack, light weapons have a -4 penalty, medium weapons have a -5 penalty, and heavy weapons have a -6 penalty to attack rolls until the end of your turn.

### Move (Tactical)
You move up to your character's movement speed.

### Focus (Tactical)
Your next melee attack roll has a +5 Tactical bonus, and can move up to 10 feet.

### Steady Aim (Tactical)
Your next ranged attack roll has a +5 Tactical bonus. You cannot use a Tactical action on your next turn.
